	Beginner's Guide to Version Control Systems (VCS)

A Version Control System is a tool that helps developers manage changes to code over time.
It records every modification made to a project, providing a detailed history of changes,
making it easy to revert to previous versions, and facilitating collaboration between
multiple developers.

Types of Version Control Systems:

1. Local Version Control Systems
2. Centralised Version Control Systems
3. Distributed Version Control Systems
