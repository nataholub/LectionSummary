	Beginner's Guide to Version Control Systems (VCS)

A Version Control System is a tool that helps developers manage changes to code over time.
It records every modification made to a project, providing a detailed history of changes,
making it easy to revert to previous versions, and facilitating collaboration between
multiple developers.

Types of Version Control Systems:

1. Local Version Control Systems
In a local VCS, all versioning is managed on a single computer. Developers manually track
changes by saving copies of the project at different stages.

2. Centralised Version Control Systems
In a CVCS, a central server stores all project files and version history. Developers work
on local copies and synchronise changes with the central server.

3. Distributed Version Control Systems
DVCS stores a complete copy of the project and version history on every developer’s
computer. Developers can work offline and synchronise changes when connected to a shared
repository.
